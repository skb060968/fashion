    content: `The Signature Elegance collection began with a simple question: How do we honor tradition while speaking to the modern woman?

Over six months, this question guided every decision—from fabric selection to silhouette development. Each piece underwent countless iterations, with a focus on achieving the perfect balance between structure and fluidity.

Working closely with artisans in Jaipur and Varanasi, we incorporated traditional embroidery techniques in unexpected ways, creating texture and depth that feels both familiar and fresh.`,

    content: `Sustainability in fashion often gets reduced to a marketing buzzword. But for us, it's foundational.

Every fabric is sourced with care—organic cottons, peace silk, and deadstock materials that would otherwise go to waste. We work with artisan communities, ensuring fair wages and preserving traditional techniques that are at risk of disappearing.

Luxury, in its truest sense, is about quality, longevity, and meaning. A garment that lasts decades, that tells a story, that was made with respect for people and planet—that is true luxury.`,

    content: `I've always been fascinated by architecture—the way buildings occupy space, how light interacts with form, the balance between function and beauty.

This fascination naturally flows into my design work. I think of garments as structures that move with the body, creating dynamic relationships between fabric and form.

The Evening Atelier collection, for instance, draws heavily from brutalist architecture—bold, dramatic, unapologetic. Clean lines meet unexpected volumes, creating silhouettes that command attention while maintaining wearability.`,
